remove the dangling symlinks, 
use stow for making symlinks for the configs
i3wm stuff is in dotfiles
my setup uses the gnome-terminal, not the alacritty one, 
use catppuccin for color schemes basically everything uses catppuccin
use hyprland instead of i3wm, 
arch ricing also with the screen-layout, 
hardcode the colors, for each item in the polybar to customize
